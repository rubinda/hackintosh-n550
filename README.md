# Hackintosh Configuration

Files that allow me to run macOS on my Asus N550JV laptop. Currently I am using OpenCore (0.5.9) with macOS Catalina.

### TODO

- fix brightness & keyboard backlighting (PNLF, AsusSMC?)
- look into power management (Dortania Post-Install)
- find a proper trackpad kext (ELAN PS2?)
- update OC (& macOS?)
- write thanks to users and guides that made this possible
